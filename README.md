# MCMCIS Algorithm
### p-value estimation for permutation tests

An efficient algorithm for estimating tail in unknown distribution, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling techniques.
Compared to the SAMC algorithm and different IS functions.

For running via teminal run: 'python3 main.py <algorithm> <example_id> <alpha> <iterations> <notes>'
